obj1.compareTo(obj2)


Here obj1 is the element which we are trying to insert.

Obj2 is the element which is already present.


TreeSet <Integer> t = new TreeSet<Integer>();
// If we doesn't pass the comparator object in the constructor then TreeSet will use the default natural sorting.

// If we want to customize sorting then we will pass the comparator object.
